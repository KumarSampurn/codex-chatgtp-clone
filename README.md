# Codex-ChatGPT-Clone

This repository hosts the source code for a chat application that utilizes OpenAI's API to power its conversational capabilities.

## Frontend

## Backend
The backend of the application is hosted [here](https://chatgtp-clone.onrender.com).

### Background
I embarked on a journey to understand how APIs work and decided to explore OpenAI's API by creating a scaled-down version of ChatGPT. With the API key in hand, I tried to integrate the capabilities of the Davinci 002 model into this chat application.

### Deprecated Notice
Please note that this project is now deprecated. Regrettably, I've utilized all the free credits available with my API key, rendering this version of the application non-functional. While the project provided valuable insights into API integration and conversational AI, it's time to explore new avenues.
